Now that we have the native side covered, let's display the data we're sending
on the desktop side.

## Scaffolding a new Desktop plugin

A new Flipper Desktop plugin can be scaffolded by running `npx flipper-pkg init` in the directory where you want to store the plugin sources (Don't run this command inside the Flipper repository itself!). 
Before running this command, make sure Flipper is closed.

For example:

```bash
mkdir ~/FlipperPlugins
cd ~/FlipperPlugins
npx flipper-pkg init
```

Add the directory to the Flipper watch folder if asked. In this tutorial we will be creating a `client` plugin. `device` plugins are only used when creating plugins that _don't_ connect to a specific application and are pretty rare.

The tool will ask you to provide "id" and "title" for your plugin. Use "sea-mammals" as "id" and "Sea Mammals" as "title". After that the tool will create two files in the directory: `package.json` and `src/index.tsx`.

After the process has finished, use `yarn watch` in the generated directory to start compiling the plugin on the fly. 

Now that our package has been set up, we are ready to build a UI for our plugin. Either by using a standardized table-based plugin, or by creating a custom UI.
